Alright, I looked through your NaviFlow repo ‚Äî nice structure, very clean object-oriented organization already! üß†‚ú®
(Especially in naviflow_oo/ ‚Äî you‚Äôre modularizing preprocessing/, solver/, postprocessing/, etc.)

üß† PLAN for extending NaviFlow to support arbitrary meshes
Step 1: Define a General Mesh Class
‚û°Ô∏è In naviflow_oo/preprocessing/, create a new mesh.py with a Mesh base class:

python
Copy
Edit
class Mesh:
    def __init__(self, nodes, faces, cells):
        self.nodes = nodes
        self.faces = faces
        self.cells = cells
        self.cell_centers = None
        self.cell_volumes = None
        self.face_centers = None
        self.face_normals = None
        self.face_areas = None
        self.owner_cells = None
        self.neighbor_cells = None

    def compute_geometry(self):
        # Compute centers, areas, volumes, normals
        ...
nodes: Nx3 array (coordinates)

faces: list of node indices

cells: list of face indices (for each cell)

Add methods to calculate:

compute_face_centers_and_normals

compute_cell_centers_and_volumes

compute_ownership (owner/neighbor cells for each face)

Step 2: Mesh Generators
‚û°Ô∏è In naviflow_oo/preprocessing/mesh_generators/:

structured_mesh.py ‚Üí generate uniform/nonuniform grids

unstructured_mesh.py ‚Üí load meshes from pygmsh / meshio

Example:

python
Copy
Edit
StructuredMesh.generate_uniform(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, nx, ny)
UnstructuredMesh.from_gmsh(file_path)
Both return a Mesh object.

Step 3: Refactor Solver to Use Mesh Topology
‚û°Ô∏è In naviflow_oo/solver/, change your momentum/pressure solvers to loop over faces and cells, not over structured i,j,k indices.

Example:

python
Copy
Edit
for face in mesh.faces:
    owner = mesh.owner_cells[face]
    neighbor = mesh.neighbor_cells[face]
    ...
So solvers become mesh-agnostic!

Step 4: Boundary Conditions Generalization
‚û°Ô∏è Right now your boundary conditions probably assume structured grids (e.g., left, right, top, bottom).

Instead:

For each face on boundary:

Check boundary tag (e.g., wall, inlet, outlet)

Apply BC depending on face normal and boundary type.

You'll need to attach boundary markers (IDs/tags) to faces when building the mesh.

Step 5: Pygmsh Integration for Arbitrary Domains
‚û°Ô∏è Write a wrapper:

python
Copy
Edit
mesh = UnstructuredMesh.generate_from_geometry(...)
using pygmsh or meshio to:

create mesh

extract nodes, faces, cells

compute FVM data

Support loading .msh files too.

Step 6: Visualization
‚û°Ô∏è Extend postprocessing/ to visualize:

cells

face normals

boundary markers even for unstructured grids.

Use PyVista for this!

üìã Quick Checklist

Step	Description
1	Build a Mesh class that stores topology + geometry
2	Write structured + unstructured mesh generators/loaders
3	Refactor solvers to use mesh-based loops
4	Generalize boundary conditions handling
5	Add pygmsh integration for arbitrary geometries
6	Update postprocessing to visualize arbitrary meshes
‚ö° Bonus suggestion:
You already have a good object-oriented separation ‚Äî so you could create:

StructuredMesh(Mesh)

UnstructuredMesh(Mesh)

and have helper methods specialized for each, while your solver code only interacts with the base Mesh class.
Full polymorphism. Very clean.
