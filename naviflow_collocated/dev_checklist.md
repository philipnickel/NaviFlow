SIMPLE Solver Developer Checklist (Moukalled-based)

üìÄ Numerical and Design Principles
	‚Ä¢	All variables (u, v, p) stored at cell centers
	‚Ä¢	Use Rhie‚ÄìChow interpolation on all internal faces
	‚Ä¢	Face-based assembly for all matrix coefficients (use Sf, d_cf, fx)
	‚Ä¢	Use Power Law for convection, central differencing for diffusion
	‚Ä¢	Follow Practice B for boundary conditions (modify matrix, not solution)
	‚Ä¢	Apply under-relaxation only after solving, not during matrix assembly
	‚Ä¢	Separate relaxed and unrelaxed field values for residual monitoring

‚öôÔ∏è Core Architecture
	‚Ä¢	Each component (mesh, discretization, solver) lives in its own class
	‚Ä¢	All numerical choices (schemes, solvers) driven by YAML config
	‚Ä¢	Use abstract base classes for all interchangeable modules
	‚Ä¢	Avoid hardcoding numerical constants ‚Äî use config or @dataclass

ü•™ Testing & Debugging
	‚Ä¢	Write all tests to be mesh-agnostic (use mesh_instance fixture)
	‚Ä¢	Validate implementation on a 2x2 mesh before scaling up
	‚Ä¢	Use field min/max and residual logs for sanity checking
	‚Ä¢	Confirm diagonal dominance and matrix symmetry as applicable
	‚Ä¢	Include regression tests for Ghia benchmark (e.g. u_center ‚âà 0.1565)

üìÑ Postprocessing & Logging
	‚Ä¢	Export intermediate fields (u, v, p) to .vtk or .csv
	‚Ä¢	Log residual history and solver convergence metrics
	‚Ä¢	Use INFO/DEBUG levels for selective verbosity

üß± Extensibility
	‚Ä¢	New schemes and solvers must subclass the appropriate ABC
	‚Ä¢	Register new components in factory maps (e.g., SCHEME_REGISTRY)
	‚Ä¢	Design every loop to be parallel-ready: no global assumptions
	‚Ä¢	Avoid coupling logic across modules (e.g., discretization shouldn‚Äôt call PETSc)
