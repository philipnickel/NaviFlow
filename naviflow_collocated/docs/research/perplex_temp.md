# Recommended Implementation Order

1. Add non-orthogonal correction vectors to `MeshData`
2. Implement BC object system with Practice B support
3. Precompute Rhie-Chow factors during mesh conversion
4. Add distributed mesh support for PETSc
5. Implement face-based stencil for matrix assembly

The current implementation covers ~70% of core SIMPLE requirements. Focus on adding the geometric correction terms and boundary condition framework modifications next. Use the 2x2 mesh validation strategy from your test plan to verify each addition.
