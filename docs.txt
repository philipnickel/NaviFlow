Lid-Driven Cavity Flow Solver Documentation

1. Discretization Method

The solver employs the Finite Volume Method on a structured Cartesian grid. 

2. Grid Arrangement

A staggered grid arrangement is utilized where:
- Pressure (p) is stored at cell centers
- u-velocity components are stored at east/west cell faces
- v-velocity components are stored at north/south cell faces

This arrangement helps prevent the checkerboard pressure field issue discussed in Chapter 6.2 of Versteeg and Malalasekera.

3. Convection-Diffusion Discretization

Power-Law scheme for the convection-diffusion terms, defined by the function:

A(F, D) = max(0, (1 - 0.1 * abs(F/D))**5)

4. Pressure-Velocity Coupling

SIMPLE 

1. Guess the pressure field p*
2. Solve the momentum equations to obtain intermediate velocities u* and v*
3. Solve the pressure correction equation
4. Correct the pressure and velocity fields
5. Solve all other discretized transport equations. Solution of linear systems is done using sparse matrix solver from SciPy.
6. Treat the corrected pressure as the new guess and repeat until convergence


6. Under-Relaxation

Under-relaxation is applied to both pressure and velocity updates to enhance stability:
- For velocities: u = alpha_u * u_new + (1-alpha_u) * u_old
- For pressure: p = p* + alpha_p * p'

The under-relaxation factors alpha_p and alpha_u are set to 0.1 and 0.7 respectively, which aligns with the recommendations in Chapter 6.4 for the SIMPLE algorithm.

7. Boundary Conditions

The following boundary conditions are implemented (Chapter 8 of Versteeg and Malalasekera):
- No-slip condition at the walls (u = v = 0)
- Moving lid at the top boundary (u = 1, v = 0)
- A fixed reference pressure point to avoid the pressure field indeterminacy

8. Convergence Criteria

The solution is considered converged when the maximum residual (the difference between consecutive iterations) falls below a specified tolerance (1e-5). This follows the residual monitoring approach described in Chapter 6.8.3 of Versteeg and Malalasekera.
