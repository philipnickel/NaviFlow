# airfoilFlow Experiment

External flow around a NACA airfoil

## Mesh Types

- **unstructured**: Unstructured mesh for flow around NACA 0012 airfoil at multiple resolutions

## Resolutions
- **coarse**: Lower resolution for quick tests
- **medium**: Balanced resolution for most simulations
- **fine**: Higher resolution for detailed flow features


## File Format
- **.msh**: Gmsh format with boundary tags
- **.vtu**: VTU format for ParaView
