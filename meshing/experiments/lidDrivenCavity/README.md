# lidDrivenCavity Experiment

Classic lid-driven cavity problem with moving top wall

## Mesh Types

- **uniform**: Uniform structured mesh for lid-driven cavity at multiple resolutions
- **unstructured**: Unstructured mesh with boundary refinement at multiple resolutions

## Resolutions
- **coarse**: Lower resolution for quick tests
- **medium**: Balanced resolution for most simulations
- **fine**: Higher resolution for detailed flow features


## File Format
- **.msh**: Gmsh format with boundary tags
- **.vtu**: VTU format for ParaView
