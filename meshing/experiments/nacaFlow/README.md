# nacaFlow Experiment

Flow around a NACA0012 airfoil in a rectangular domain

## Mesh Types

- **unstructured**: Unstructured mesh for flow around a NACA0012 airfoil at multiple resolutions

## Resolutions
- **coarse**: Lower resolution for quick tests
- **medium**: Balanced resolution for most simulations
- **fine**: Higher resolution for detailed flow features


## File Format
- **.msh**: Gmsh format with boundary tags
- **.vtu**: VTU format for ParaView
